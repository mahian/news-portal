        <div class="p-5">
            <p>In javascript user cann declare a variable by using three keywords, var, let and const. Threre are some difference among them.</p>
    
            <p>Var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in js. The scope of the var keyword is the global scope or funvtion scope that's mean variable defined outside the function can be accessed globally.</p>
    
            <p>Let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessable outside the particular block.</p>
    
            <p>Const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword except the user can't update it. When user declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise it returns error. User can't update the const variable once it is declared.</p>

        <div class="p-5">
            <p>Arrow function is a new feature of ES6, It is a more concise syntex for writing function expression. Both regular and arrow function are works in similar manner, there are some difference between them </p>

            <p>Arrow function don't have any argument binding. However they have access to the arguments object of the closet non-arrow parent function.</p>

            <p>Unlike regular function, arrow function don't have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closet non-arrow parent</p>

        <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 text-decoration-underline">What are the difference of map, for each, filter and find?</h3>

        <div class="p-5">
            <p>Map returns an array with the same length, filter as the name implies, it returns an array with less items than the original array.</p>

            <p>We use map when we want to transform elements in an array. we use for each when we need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Use of filte, when we want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array. For want to select a single element from an array, we use find.</p>
